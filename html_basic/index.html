            <h1>Healthy lifestyle and longevity</h1>
            <p>Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a massive study of the impact of
                health
                habits on life expectancy, using data from the well-known Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and the Health
                Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). This means that they had data on a huge number of people over a
                very long
                period of time. The NHS included over 78,000 women and followed them from 1980 to 2014. The HPFS
                included over
                40,000 men and followed them from 1986 to 2014. This is over 120,000 participants, 34 years of data for
                women,and 28 years of data for men</p>
            <p>The researchers looked at NHS and HPFS data on diet, physical activity, body weight, smoking, and alcohol
                consumption that had been collected from regularly administered, validated questionnaires</p>
            <h2>What is a healthy lifestyle, exactly?</h2>
            <p>These five areas were chosen because prior studies have shown them to have a large impact on risk of
                premature
                death. Here is how these healthy habits were defined and measured</p>
            <h3>Does a healthy lifestyle make a difference?</h3>
            <p>As it turns out, healthy habits make a big difference. According to this analysis, people who met
                criteria for
                all five habits enjoyed significantly, impressively longer lives than those who had none: 14 years for
                women and
                12 years for men (if they had these habits at age 50). People who had none of these habits were far more
                likely
                to die prematurely from cancer or cardiovascular disease.</p>
